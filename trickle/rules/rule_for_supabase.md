When working with MOLOVE database
- Always use Supabase as primary database
- Use localStorage as backup/cache only
- All CRUD operations go through window.supabaseClient
- Products table: name, article, category, price, images[], description, sizes (JSONB), published
- Orders table: order_number, customer info, items (JSONB), total_amount, status
- Check Supabase connection before operations
- Fallback to localStorage if Supabase unavailable
- Use RLS policies for security (public read published, admin write all)
- Always handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Cache frequently accessed data in memory
